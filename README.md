# onfido
A simple Go package for interacting with Onfido. See the [godoc documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/outdoorsy/onfido) for more info.

This package is nowhere near as complete as I would like it to be. Time constraints have forced me to write only the things that I needed immediately.

Eventually, all functionality will be complete, a proper README will be created and it will be very nice.

For now, if it is missing functionality you need, please submit a PR to add it. For any issues you encounter, please submit an issue.

Thanks!
